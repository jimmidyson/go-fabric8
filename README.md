gofabric8 is used to validate &amp; deploy fabric8 components on to your Kubernetes or OpenShift environment

Find more information at http://fabric8.io.

## Getting started

### Install / Update & run

Get the [latest](https://github.com/fabric8io/gofabric8/releases/latest/) `gofabric8` or use the following script to download it.

```
curl -sS https://get.fabric8.io/download.txt | bash
```
add '~/.fabric8/bin' to your path so you can execute the new binaries, for example:
edit your ~/.zshrc or ~/.bashrc  and append to the end of the file
```
export PATH=$PATH:~/.fabric8/bin
source ~/.zshrc or ~/.bashrc
```

#### minikube
```
gofabric8 install
```
#### minishift

```
gofabric8 install --minishift
```

### Install the fabric8 microservices platform

To install the [fabric8 microservices platform](http://fabric8.io/) then run the following:

```sh
gofabric8 deploy
```

If you are deploying to a remote OpenShift instance make sure to set the domain so we can generate Toutes to access applications
```
gofabric8 deploy --domain=your.domain.io
```

### Reusing the Docker daemon

When developing locally and using a single VM its really handy to reuse the Docker daemon inside the VM; as this means you don't have to build on your host machine and push the image into a docker registry - you can just build inside the same docker daemon as minikube which speeds up local experiments.

To be able to work with the docker daemon on your mac/linux host use the docker-env command in your shell:

```
eval $(gofabric8 docker-env)
```
you should now be able to use docker on the command line on your host mac/linux machine talking to the docker daemon inside the minikube VM:

```
docker ps
```
Remember to turn off the imagePullPolicy:Always, as otherwise kubernetes won't use images you built locally.

### Run different versions

When deploying, by default the latest release version is used.  In order to deploy a specific version you can use the various`--version-xxxx` flags as detailed under

```
gofabric8 deploy help
```

or to your ``~/.zshrc`` if you use zsh ::

```sh
  source <(gofabric8 completion zsh)
```
